Welcome:
        
    My name is Caleb Schmitt and this is a project that I have started to  help new Students in my
    Computer Networking class. I decided to start this project because I seen the problems I was 
    Having when I first started the class and wanted to use my knowlage in python to help some
    of the newer students if they were having the same trouble.

Idea:
        
    The idea of this basic AI is to be able to calculate and and help with some of the questions
    and problems that a newer Computer Networking student may have when they are starting the 
    class or going though the class. I am hoping that the newer students will use this basic AI
    to help them get a better understanding of the class and maybe use this AI to help them
    study for finals or test.

What Can The AI Do:
    
    Can help new students with identifing and finding a network address using basic class C subnetting
    
    Can help new students with identifing and finding the proper number conferstions of decimal, hex, and binary
    
    Can help new studnets with idnetifing and finding the difference between the north and south bridge of a PC's
    motherboard
    
    Can help new students with identifing the correct color combination for a straite though, cross-over and roll-over
    network cable

Contributors:

    As of day one I will be using my own knolage of the class and python to be making this AI
    if needed I will be reaching out to my fellow classmates who have exspiriance in python
    and have completed the Computer Networking class with a 90% or better. 
    
    As I started to work more on the AI i started to get stuck on what I should teach it to do
    after asking my fellow class mates they gave me a couple of ideas on thing that could be 
    usefull to the new and incoming studnets. After hearing their ideas it helped me create and
    get some more ideaas of my own.

Languages used: 

    The programming language that I will be using is python. I will be using python because
    I am very familiar with it as a language and have a decent amount of exspiriance with it.

Future: 

    The future that I see for this basic AI is that it will be used to help all types of new 
    students that enter the Computer Networking program. I might exspaind the AI to run off
    a homemade web server running off a Raspberry Pi so that people can access it from 
    anywhere, but as of right now it will be running localy in the Computer Networking 
    classroom.

Final regards:

    If you would like to follow me along in this project and see my achiments and strugles
    there is a file called Project_Logs.md where I will be recording my thought process 
    though the journy of making this AI.
