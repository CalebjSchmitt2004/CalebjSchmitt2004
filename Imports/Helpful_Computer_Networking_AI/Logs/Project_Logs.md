Day 1:

    Hour 0 - Hour 1:
        Goals: 
            Complete the base UI to welcome the user to the AI.

            Craft and make a base laoding bar to hold the program while the 
            the user reads the intro.

            Get base entry for subnetting and calculation.

        Completed:
            Completed base UI to welcome user
    
            Built the base loading bar and welcome screen

        Problems or Concerns:
        
            My first problem was with the base UI getting the program to
            be able to go thpugh and allow a user to read all the information
            being given to them. Once the program got going though I didn't hit
            anouther problem until it came to building the loading bar. Getting 
            the laoding bar up and running was simple but getting the program to
            access the exsternal file where the code was tricky so I emplimented 
            the loading animation into the base method code.

        Goals for next hour: 
                
            My goals for the next hour are to get the program asking the user 
            what process they would like the AI to help them with and Hopefully
            getting the AI to exicute the code perfectly "Hopefully".


    Hour 1 - Hour 2:
        Goals:
            Gather user input for what process the user would like the AI
            to help them with.
